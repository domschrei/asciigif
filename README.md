# asciigif
Downloads a gif from /r/gifs, and displays it in ASCII art in the terminal.

## Installation

Drop the script `asciigif` into some binary folder which is included in your `$PATH`, e.g. `~/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.

If you want to make the script run each time you open a terminal, you can append the command `asciigif` to your `~/.bashrc`.
